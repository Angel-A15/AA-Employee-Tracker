# Employee Tracker

## Project
My client is a busines owner that requests if I could integrate an application that would allow her to view manage the departments, roles, and employees of her company. She believes this will improve her skills in organizing and planning her business.

Her ideal layout for the application is as follows:
  * Starting the application introduces her to a nav with directory;
    * view all departments
    * view all roles
    * view all employees
    * add a department
    * add a role
    * add an employee
    * and update an employee role
    
  * Selecting a directory pertaining to "view all..." should display all current information
  * Selecting a directory pertaining to "add a..." should ask for the user to input information and add to the database when done
  * Selecting "update an employee role" should ask user which employee to select and update, then add to database when done
