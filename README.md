# Employee Tracker

## Project
My client is a busines owner that requests if I could integrate an application that would allow her to view manage the departments, roles, and employees of her company. She believes this will improve her skills in organizing and planning her business.

Her ideal layout for the application is as follows:
  * Starting the application introduces her to a nav with directory;
    * view all departments
    * view all roles
    * view all employees
    * add a department
    * add a role
    * add an employee
    * and update an employee role
    
  * Selecting a directory pertaining to "view all..." should display all current information
  * Selecting a directory pertaining to "add a..." should ask for the user to input information and add to the database when done
  * Selecting "update an employee role" should ask user which employee to select and update, then add to database when done
  
## Description
in order to meet my clients requests, I executed the following:
 * Added a series of prompts that gather information the user entered and for guidance
 * Sql files to represent what the expected layout of the database tables the user will be constructing
 * Using MySQL and NPM, the application will add and alter data based on the users input

## Installation
The user will need to have these installed before usage:
  * NPM Inquirer
  * mySQL2
  * console.table package
  
## Usage
To start the app, enter "npm start" into the terminal and then select which directory you want
